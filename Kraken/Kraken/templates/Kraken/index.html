<h3>Welcome to Kraken Operations Center!</h3><br>
<p>
    Kraken is a tool to help make your pentest workflow more efficient when reviewing web interfaces. This is done by using a database (currently Postgresql) to track web interface data. This allows you to take notes mark interfaces with default credentials configured. Once you are done, you can view these systems and the notes you took in the <a href="Logs/reports">Reports</a> section. To get started, make your way over to <a href="WebScout/setup">Web Scout's Setup page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Instructions:</b>
    <a href="WebScout">Web Scout</a> is what you will use to scan for an review the web interfaces available to you on a given network. Currently, this requires the XML file from the following Nmap scan:
</p>
<div class="well">
    nmap -sV --open -T4 -v7 -p80,280,443,591,593,981,1311,2031,2480,3181,4444,4445,4567,4711,4712,5104,5280,7000,7001,7002,8000,8008,8011,8012,8013,8014,8042,8069,8080,8081,8243,8280,8281,8443,8531,8887,8888,9080,9443,11371,12443,16080,18091,18092 -iL live-hosts.txt -oA web
</div>
<p>
    I plan to add better parsing functionality soon. Once you have this XML file, visit the <a href="WebScout/setup">Web Scout's Setup page</a> and enter the absolute path to the XML file and click "Parse File". This will parse the data within the Nmap XML file into the database. A popup message will notify you when complete. The last step for setup is to click the "Take Screenshots" button. This will take a while. The screenshot taking script currently uses 25 threads, each with a Selenium PhantomJS web driver, so it is fairly resource intensive. Progress can be tracked by looking in the '/opt/Kraken/Web_Scout/static/Web_Scout/' folder as screenshots are saved there. A progress bar is going to be added in the future for better process tracking. 
</p>
<p>
    Once all of your screenshots are taken, visit <a href="WebScout">Web Scout's main page</a> to the listing of your web interfaces.  Each host gets a 'well'. Each web interace hosted by that host is group into that well along with IP, hostname, and basic port information. Clicking a screenshot thumbnail will popup a larger image along with more information about that interface. Within this popup you can also take notes and check the check boxes for HTTP Authentication or Default Credentials. Hit save to record those notes in the database. 
</p>
<p>
    You can cycle through the interfaces on each page using the popup by either clicking the Next/Previous buttons or hitting the right/left arrows on your keyboard. Clicking "Open" will open another tab where that interface will attempt to load into an iframe with a Kraken toolbar at the top. The toolbar allows you to take the same notes you can with the popup. There is also a link in case the page is not able to load in the iframe. My workflow is to go through a couple of Web Scout pages using the popup and open web interfaces in the background as I go (Ctrl + left-click for Windows or Option + left-click for Mac). I then go through the tabs and take notes as I go.
